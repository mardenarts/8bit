<div class="container"> <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p>Throughout the more than 10 years that I have been working with 8bit-football.com, I have been asked a couple of questions. I tried to summarize them here:</p>
<h4>What is 8bit-football?</h4>
<p>8bit-Football is a blog where I share illustrations about football (or soccer) based on 8-bit graphics as we used to play in video games in the 90's.</p>
<h4>How many people are behind 8bit-football?</h4>
<p>So far only one, with a full time job (not related to this). All the illustrations are done in my free time. This is my hobby, which I am glad to share with those of similar taste. ðŸ™‚</p>
<h4>Where are you from?</h4>
<p>Brazil.</p>
<h4>Do you take requests?</h4>
<p>Yes, in fact most of the illustrations come from requests from Facebook and Twitter. But since I am only one with limited time, it is hard to cope with them all.</p>
<h4>I support a team from the 5th division in Andorra, will you take my request?</h4>
<p>I really would like to, but I must confess that it does not happen quite often. For less popular clubs, I try to draw simple illustrations, most of the time sharing them on Twitter, just so people can be happy to see them there. So, donâ€™t give up!</p>
<h4>Can you draw an 8bit picture of me?</h4>
<p>If you are a football player, yes. Otherwise, I prefer not to take such personal requests, as I like to devote the limited time that I have to the website.</p>
<h4>Do you do commissioned work?</h4>
<p>Yes. If you are interested, please get in touch via the Contact section and we can discuss it.</p>
<h4>Which tool do you use to draw?</h4>
<p>I use an iPad and an application called Pixaki.</p>
<h4>Can I buy a t-shirt or a poster with your illustrations?</h4>
<p>Yes. Check our <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/8bitfootball" target="_blank">shop here</a>.</p>
<h4>Can I advertise on 8bit Football?</h4>
<p>Depends. I try not to take a commercial approach with the website since it is for a hobby. Therefore, no advertise banners everywhere to pollute the website (or window popups). Alternatively, I work with sponsored posts (helps me paying the expenses that I have with the website). The only requirement is that they should be always be followed by an 8bit illustration. You can also choose to advertise on the videos adboards.</p>
<h4>Do you sell your work as NFT?</h4>
<p>I do not and I have no interest in NFT at this moment (nothing against it meant). Be aware of scammers trying impersonate me and selling my art!</p> </div>
