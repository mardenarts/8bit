  <h1>Can Swansea City take on Chelsea this season?</h1>
  <p class="post_date">Posted on 11 September 2014</p>
  <div class="post_content">
  <p><span style="line-height: 1.625em;">Against all odds, Swansea City now find themselves in second place for the Premier League, one place behind the unstoppable force that is Chelsea.</span>
<img class="post_image" alt="" src="/images/blog/can-swansea-city-take-on-chelsea-this-season-1.png" />
The Jacks had a fantastic start to the Premier League when they managed to beat Manchester United 2-1, setting in motion a series of wins that would change their fates from last year’s 12th place. Despite Louis van Gaal’s promise of a “new era”, the Red Devils have yet to deliver, and now Swansea City could be setting the tone for this season.
<span style="line-height: 1.625em;">One challenge that’s going to test the boys’ strength this month is their upcoming pairing with Chelsea. The boys will be travelling to Stamford Bridge on 13th September to take on the top table champions, but will have a huge task ahead of them as Jose Mourinho sends out his first 11.</span>
<span style="line-height: 1.625em;">One Chelsea powerhouse that Swansea City manager Garry Monk should be aware of is newly-signed Diego Costa. The Spaniard made the switch from Atlético Madrid to Chelsea in July, at a cost of £32 million to the Blues, but he was more than a worthy investment. With the current standings, Costa has scored the most goals in the Premier League so far, scoring a total of four in three games.</span>
<span style="line-height: 1.625em;">This has not eluded the attentions of manager Jose Mourinho, who was particularly pleased with Costa following their outstanding 6-3 victory over Everton. He said: “He produced a fantastic performance in every aspect. I remember in the first half he was tackling Coleman on the edge of our box. He recovered balls, he held the ball up, and he was aggressive. His movement, his quality – everything was really good.”</span>
<span style="line-height: 1.625em;">Costa is not the only </span><a href="http://blog.betsafe.com/en-blog/2014/08/27/chelsea-champs-leage/" style="line-height: 1.625em;">new signing who could turn things around for Chelsea</a><span style="line-height: 1.625em;">. Former Arsenal star Cesc Fabregas has proven his worth thus far, particularly during Chelsea’s early game against Burnley.</span>
However, after beating Manchester United, Burnley FC and West Bromwich Albion, Swansea have proven that they’re not going to go down with a fight. They’ve clearly shown that they have what it takes to beat a former top table Premier League team; moreover playing away from home is nothing to fear for the Jacks.
While nobody can predict the result, it’ll certainly be an exciting game as a former middle of the league team try to bolster their reputation and beat this year’s potential champions.
