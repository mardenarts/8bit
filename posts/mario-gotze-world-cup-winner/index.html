  <h1>Mario Götze World Cup Winner</h1>
  <p class="post_date">Posted on 13 July 2014</p>
  <div class="post_content">
  <p>After one month of intensive football, tonight we finally met new World Champion: Germany! The final against Argentina took place in Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro and, just like the last World Cup finals, 90 minutes were not sufficient to determine the winner. It was on the second half of extra time when Mario Götze who came to the pitch replacing Miroslav Klose, scored the goal that gave the fourth World Cup trophy to the Germans.

Germany came to the final as favorites. Following a crushing victory by 7-1 against the host country Brazil, the team managed by Joachim Löw was ready to end the 24 years drought of world trophies. Argentina, on its turn, seemed the most prepared team to stop the German plans. All the necessary elements were there, including a solid Messi throughout the whole tournament and a massive crowd of Argentinian supporters taking over the streets of Rio.
It was a very balanced match, with clear chances for both sides. Argentina was closer to take the lead when Higuain missed a face-to-face opportunity against Neuer in the first half. On the other side of the pitch, the Argentinian goalkeeper Sergio Romero had a busy time, trying to stop the most effective attack of the competition. Eventually, the match went to extra-time and the drama continued. When it seemed that both teams were ready for a penalty shootout decision, the goal came. On the 113th minute, after a cross from the left by Schurrle, Götze controlled the ball with his chest and struck a left-footed shot to the back of the net. No chances for Romero.
This goal also closes the series of illustrations for the World Cup 2014. We specially want to thank all who followed every 8bit moment published through the blog and social networks. The exposure of 8bit Football on world media was far larger than anything we have seen before. That only brings more inspiration to keep on going, so thank you very much. And yes, next step: Euro 2015.</p>
