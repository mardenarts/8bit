  <h1>Will Arsene Wenger retire at the end of the season?</h1>

After taking over as Arsenal manager in 1996, perhaps the time has come for Wenger to consider his retirement at the end of the 2015-16 campaign. <a href="http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/clubs/managers/profile.overview.html/arsene-wenger">The Frenchman has led the Gunners to a number of successes</a>, including six FA Cup trophies, three Premier League titles and that ‘Invincibles’ season in the 2003-04 campaign.
Arsenal’s success has dried up in recent years, however, and only back-to-back FA Cup triumphs have saved Wenger from the sack. In a week where Arsenal claimed a 2-1 victory away at archrivals Tottenham Hotspur and Wenger announced that he was set to separate from his wife Annie, we take a look at the chances of the Frenchman departing from the club at the end of the season.
Wenger’s record at the club is absolutely sensational but he has failed to lead a serious title challenge since their last success in 2004. Without a doubt, the Frenchman is a world class manager and will deservedly leave the Emirates Stadium with a long-standing legacy that is almost unrivalled in the modern era. This season, many believed that Arsenal could win the Premier League title but they have endured an inconsistent start to the campaign. <a href="http://sports.coral.co.uk/football/results" rel="dofollow">For more news, results and information on the Gunners, you can visit Coral’s website</a>.
Many Arsenal fans have been calling for Wenger’s head for quite some time but it could be argued that he has earned the right to depart as and when he wants to. The Frenchman is, after all, the most celebrated and successful manager in the illustrious history of Arsenal Football Club and it wouldn’t be a huge surprise to see the club pay their respects and recognise his achievements in some way.
Unfortunately, Wenger is looking a lot frailer in his old age. Whether this is due to the <a href="http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2015/03/01/9382692/wenger-i-am-under-pressure-at-arsenal">intense media pressure or inconsistent opinion of the supporters</a>, the Gunners boss almost looks ready for retirement and his tactical nous, which was once his greatest trait of all, has been questioned by pundits, players and fans throughout the game.
It would be foolish to suggest that Wenger has completely lost his managerial nous but there are certainly plenty of signs that would support such an opinion. Arsenal need a fresh, young manager to take the club to the next level. At times, Wenger appears a little too content in his role at Arsenal – as if he knows that the club would never sack him.
Arsene Wenger is one of the greatest managers in all-time and there is no doubt that his managerial career will be viewed as a huge success in years to come. <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/premierleague/article-2765030/Man-United-s-aura-invincibility-went-Sir-Alex-Ferguson-retired-Leicester-just-latest-turn-history-upside-Louis-van-Gaal-struggles-restore-fear-factor-lost-David-Moyes.html">Manchester United struggled to adapt after Sir Alex Ferguson left the club</a> and Arsenal will find it equally as tricky to move on. While the Frenchman is yet to make a decision on his future, it wouldn’t be a huge surprise to see him announce his retirement – a choice that will be respected, if not welcomed, by the majority of Arsenal fans.
